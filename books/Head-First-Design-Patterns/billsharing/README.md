Flow:

First create an Expense Group 
Add Users to the expense group (this should be done at beginning after creating group) 


Operation allowed in the Expense Group
- Add a new member
- Remove a member
- Create an expense report

Each expense has expense strategy
- Equal share
- 

- At the time of creation of an Expense in a group, we'll take the snap of 
  the members of the groups


Create an expense in a group
You can create n number of expense in a group

We can't add new members to the same group.. because that would require us to
record which members shares a given expense (which is not good design)

A user can do n number of contribution to an expense in the group 

An expense is settled when every one has paid the amount

Each expense has an expense owner (who created this expense)

Each expense belongs to an unique expense group 

Each contribution has a contribution value
